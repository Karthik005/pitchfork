Deployment:
Install django from the python repository (pip install django). Download or fork the repository. Once inside the main directory, configure the database settings in the settings.py file (pitchfork/settings.py) to require values and run:

./manage.py migrate

to migrate the models to the local database. Then run:

./manage.py runserver <port-number

to run the server. The default port is 8000.
